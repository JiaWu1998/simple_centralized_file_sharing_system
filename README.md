# simple_centralized_file_sharing_system

This project is a centralized file-sharing system. The idea is to make a hierarchical peer-to-peer system where there are strong peers and weak peers. Multiple weak peers would connect to a relative strong peer. A relative strong peer would host a file list of all relative weak peers that are connected to it.
